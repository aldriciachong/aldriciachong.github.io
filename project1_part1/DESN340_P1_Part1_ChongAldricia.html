Smudge is seated in a black leather chair, his head is angled away from the camera which instigates drama unfolding behind the camera. Most importantly, infront of him are strategically placed vegetables on a plate, still untouch; representing his hunger and reasoning for his upsetting bewildered expression.

		The chatoic, passionate, rageful lady comes from over a decade ago. What was and still is popular, that's right, The Real Housewives. So who might this lady be; Icon Taylor Armstrong. 
		This heartwrenching composition captured through the lens of a show camera illustrates Taylor confronting Camille Grammar who is out of frame. Fingers are being pointed, tears are being shed, mouths are yelling profanities. This chaotic toned image is balanced with grace, calmness, and protection through the subject Kyle Richards, who is on Taylor's side. Kyle's body language can be interpreted in a well rehearsed action of attempting to calm Taylor down. But alas, this dramatic screaming scene continues to ensue, snowballing into one of the most iconic collaboration between two opposite ends of the internet.

			<li>The Real Housewives</li> 
			<li>Fingers Pointed</li>
			<li>Tears shed</li>
			<li>Chaos vs Grace</li>
